title: "Don't teach me"
---

The most dangerous words a newbie can say is "Teach me". Every time I feel like going to an expert and asking him or her to "teach me", I end up disappointed, frustrated and at times, publically humiliated.  

But really, it's my fault. No one wants that kind of responsibility. No one really wants to sit down and teach someone. Who has the time? The title of mentor is most adorned when it’s easy and the guidance to be offered is minimal. 

The thing is, in the end, you gotta figure it out on your own. There's no avoiding that. You need to study. Make mistakes. Burn. And slowly get good at what you want to get good at. And the only thing you should ask an expert are questions about specific scenarios - the kind of questions that aren’t answered by books or documentation. But most of all, watch how they solve problems - learn by watching.
