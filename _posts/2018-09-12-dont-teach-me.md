title: "Don't teach me"
---

The most dangerous words a newbie can say is "Teach me". Every time I've went to an expert and asked him or her to "teach me", I end up disappointed at what little they have to offer, frustrated that they can't solve my problem and at times, humiliated by said expert for not knowing what I've come to ask. But really, it's my fault. My approach was horrendously wrong. Here are three lessons I've learnt.

**Lesson #1: Don't expect to be taught.**

No one wants that kind of responsibility. No one really wants to sit down and teach you. Who has the time? The title of mentor is most adorned when it’s easy and the guidance to be offered is minimal. The only thing you should ask an expert are questions about specific scenarios - the kind of questions that aren’t answered by books or documentation. But most of all, watch how they solve problems - learn by watching. 

This applies to companies as well. The company is not responsible for teaching you anything. It will not spoon-feed you. They've hired you because you have something to offer them. That said, the company will provide a platform on which you can apply what you’ve learnt. Identify those opportunities quickly and leverage them to the best of your ability. 

**Lesson #2: Learn the art of learning.**

The thing is, in the end, you gotta figure it out on your own. There's no avoiding that. You need to study. Make mistakes. Burn. And slowly get good at what you want to get good at. Mentorship or not, there's no escaping the hours of study.

The company is a group of people where each individual is skilled in a specific domain. Identify what you wish to improve on, and find those people who can help you do that. While no one has all the answers, at least know that it’s always faster to learn things together than when you’re on your own. Find passionate people to ask questions from. Again, don't expect them to teach you, but look for friends to guide you when you get stuck. 

**Lesson #3: Swimmer's Body Fallacy.**

One of biggest illusions I've fallen prey to is the Swimmer's Body Fallacy. It states that one tends to assume that professional swimmers have perfect bodies because they swim extensively. However, that is not the case. Instead, they are good swimmers because of their physiques. 

Let me put it in another way. Does going to Harvard make your smarter? Or do smart people go to Harvard? 

Let me tweak the statement to make it a bit more relevant. Are people smart because they had the right mentorship? Or do mentors seek out smart people?
