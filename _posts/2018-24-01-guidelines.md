title: Guidelines
---

If I look back at the many blogs I’ve started, there has always been a significant drop in quality over time. I believe this is mostly because I forgot the guiding principles I had in mind when I first started them. I will not make that mistake again.

I’ve written guidelines that every post in this blog should adhere to. Whoever is reading this is free to challenge any post if it doesn’t follow them below:

### Anonymous. 
I don't want to hold back as I share the more personal episodes of my life. Nor should it ever affect the friends or family who I mention. It is a collection of unadulterated brutal reflections of an otherwise charming gentleman. 

### Meaningful. 
This is not a scrap book where I shit out whatever comes to mind. Neither is this a publication where I have to squeeze out crowd pleasers and meet deadlines. It is a collection of the ideas that have helped me and would help me if I could travel back in time and share it with the confused inexperienced crybaby I once used to be. 

### Single Responsibility. 
When you say three things, you say nothing. Every post must offer no more than one idea to ponder about. But you are free to make any number of posts and link them to one another. 

### Impermanence.  
Once a post is written, it can be appended to, improved or even replaced later. You are free to iterate over it any number of times. After all, rewriting is the essence of writing.
