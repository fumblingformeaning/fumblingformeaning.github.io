title: "A man's hobbies"
---

The first time I heard the words, I was sitting in the office cafeteria eating lunch. I happen to be sitting near the CEO and a colleague who were deep in conversation. There wasn't anything better to do so I chewed and listened. Much of it was small talk. But amidst the garbage, I heard the following lines:

> A man must have 3 hobbies. One that makes him money. One that keeps him in shape. One that allows him to be creative. - Unknown

The words struck a cord. So much so that as an eavesdropper, I interrupted the CEO to repeat the line. I felt like I found a missing piece of a puzzle I've been trying to figure out for far too long. 

Everything comes down to balance. As important as it is to find a means to survive, one must also take care of his body. And yet, one cannot ignore the needs of the mind. Don’t spend all your time on one single cause. Even now, I’m relentlessly trying to master my trade (through online courses and side projects), experiment with different workouts (like parkour, mixed martial arts, swimming and horse riding), and refine my writing and presentation skills.

Over time, I've read a good number of books, blog posts, poems, speeches and comics that touch the subject of life's purpose, finding happiness and overcoming adversity. I've come across a number of passages that have helped me come closer to finding answers to who I want to be, what I want to do and why. I collect these words. I play around with them. Sometimes I add a few of my own. It's a hobby.

And that's what this blog is all about. *Fumbling For Meaning* is where I write about my journey and the epiphanies that come along on the way.
