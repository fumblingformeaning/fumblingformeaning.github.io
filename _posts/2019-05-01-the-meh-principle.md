title: "The MEH principle"
---

Often, we come across people who are difficult to deal with or people who make us feel bad. 

I’ve found the principle of MEH to be quite helpful in this regard. An easy to remember mnemonic that focuses on 3 aspects:

**M: I am the Master of my fate.**

I quote the last two lines of Invictus
   * I am the master of my fate, 
   * I am the captain of my soul.

First and foremost, remind yourself that you are the captain of your soul. Nobody can tell you different. 

**E: Expectations. Kill em all.**

Expectation, I’ve found, is the root of all disappointment.
If you remove expectations of
   * the good that may happen, or 
   * the bad that may ensue

Do this, and you will free yourself of disappointment and unnecessary excitement. 

**H: We are all Human beings**

There are no super-villains in life. Just people following different directions. 
Sometimes, we collide and things get ugly. But that collision shouldn’t derail you from your original goal. And if it does, make sure, you move through an even richer path. 

And there you have it. MEH.
