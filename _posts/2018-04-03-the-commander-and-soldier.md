title: "The Commander and the Solider"
---

I believe I exist in two states of mind. Each has a part to play, each equally important, and yet one often surpresses the other. 

I call them the Commander and the Soldier. But you can choose whatever you feel comfortable with. The Thinker and the Doer. The Astronomer and the Astronaut. The Brains and Brawn. The Captain and the Sailor. It doesn't matter what you call them. What matters is the role they have to play. 

**The Commander is the embodiment of my long-term thinking.** He has marvelous plans about the future. He sees patterns, understands systems and finds newer ways to extract maximum value with minimum effort. *The commander is responsible for ideas*. Itâ€™s fun being a commander. 

The only problem is, without action, all of what is said is but a happy fantasy. This is where the soldier comes in. 

**The Soldier is the embodiment of my action.** If the soldier is incompetent, the finest commander is rendered useless. Therefore, *it is the soldier's responsibility to both develop himself and deliver on his targets*. It's not fun being the soldier. But his role is crucial. He must sweat in training and bleed in battle for the future promised by the commander. 

But make no mistake, without the commander and his vision for the future, the soldier is reduced to but an animal acting on his immediate base desires. Both states of mind are important. **There must be balance.**
