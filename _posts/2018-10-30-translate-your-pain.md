title: "Translate your pain into action"
---

There have been so many moments when I'm overwhelmed with shame and disgust. I feel weak and in a state where I either blame the world or specific individuals. And in an attempt to alleviate that pain, I ask myself, "Do I deserve this?". 

But the thing is, it usually is my fault. If I didn’t know or I was scared, I can forgive myself for that. But, that doesn’t excuse me from the pain. The consequences of your actions are absolute, irrespective of your intentions. You fucked up, now deal with it. 

There's this Bushido saying:
> "The decisions you make and the actions that follow are a reflection of who you are. You can not hide from yourself."

That said, whenever you feel like shit, **I want you to be grateful.** You've been given an opportunity to fix a problem about yourself. Your mental anguish, like any physical pain, is your body telling you that *you need to be aware of the damage and do something about it*. You need to either fix your environment or yourself. You are accountable to yourself. You are responsible for yourself. 

But it's not going to be easy. Especially when you can't focus and are constantly distracted by your own thoughts. *I refer to this self-loathing self-destructive overthinking as an infection*. And the only way to fix it is to follow the steps below:

**Step 1: Recognize the Infection**

Accept where you are right now. You can not escape it immediately. Once you've learnt to accept it, identify the problem. Figure out what you can do to fix it or improve your circumstances.

If you need time to decide or can't seem to focus enough to create an action plan, *sleep*. Nothing calms the mind like a good night's rest. If you’re not doing a physical activity, then start. If you’re not doing anything, then start doing something. Try waking up early. This infection is no excuse for inaction. Inaction feeds lethargy. Lethargy feeds the infection. A cycle of pain that only paralyses you. 

**Step 2: Translate your pain into Action**

After a while, this pain is no longer useful. Once it helps you identify what needs to be done, reject it. Make it irrelevant. It's wasting your time and energy. Focus on only the task at hand and do it to the best of your ability. You'll be slow at first and the results of your efforts may seem pointless. In spite of it, keep pushing yourself to act. Understand that it will take time. 

In a few months, you will notice a difference. It will get better. Just keep pushing.
