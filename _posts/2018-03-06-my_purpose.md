title: "What is my purpose?"
---

There is much that you do not know,<br/>
much that you can not do,<br/>
and much of which you are too afraid to even try.<br/>

Your purpose has always been one thing. <br/>
To master yourself.

The principles of a man who can do anything:

The **discipline** to build himself <br/>
The **will** to make it happen

The **patience** to learn, unlearn and relearn <br/>
The **faith** in himself to *endure* 

The **humility** to always *listen* <br/>
The **self-awareness** to know when you lose your way

The **spirit** to *challenge* <br/>
The **courage** to lead
