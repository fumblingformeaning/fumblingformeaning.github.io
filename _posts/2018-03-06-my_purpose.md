title: "What is my purpose?"
---

There is much that you do not know,
much that you can not do,
and much of which you are too afraid to even try.

Your purpose has always been one thing. 
To master yourself. 

--

The **discipline** to build himself
The **will** to make it happen

The **patience** to learn, unlearn and relearn
The **faith** in himself to *endure* 

The **humility** to always *listen*
The **self-awareness** to know when you lose your way

The **spirit** to *challenge*
The **courage** to lead
