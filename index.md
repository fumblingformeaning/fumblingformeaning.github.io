I’ve read a good number of books, blog posts, poems, speeches and comics that touch the subject of life’s purpose, finding happiness and overcoming adversity. I’ve come across a number of passages that have helped me come closer to finding answers to who I want to be, what I want to do and why. I collect these words. I play around with them. Sometimes I add a few of my own. It’s a hobby.

*Fumbling For Meaning* is where I write about my journey and the epiphanies that come along the way.
